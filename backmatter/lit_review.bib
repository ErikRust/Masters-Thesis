It is shown to be based on a misconception of the objectives and assumptions of metabolic control theory. In particular, the control and elasticity coefficients that play a central role in metabolic control theory are not constants and cannot be treated as constants. Consequently they cannot in general be equated with the kinetic orders that appear in biochemical systems theory, though they do correspond at the point where the two theories are tangential to one another. {\textcopyright} 1989 Academic Press Limited.},

@book{Boogerd2007,
abstract = {This book, Systems Biology: Philosophical Foundations, represents the culmi- nation of our studies on a number of philosophical issues related to systems biology we have undertaken in the recent years. In 1999, Hans Westerhoff, Frank Bruggeman, and Fred Boogerd from the Department of Molecular Cell Physiology (Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) embarked on a project called ‘Living reductionism', supported by the Vrije Universiteit through a so-called USF-grant. We gratefully acknowl- edge the contribution of Willem Drees (Leiden University) in the initial phase of the project. In the beginning, our department collaborated with the Departments of Artifical Intelligence (Jan Treur) and Theoretical Psychology (Huib Looren-de Jong) of the Vrije Universiteit to study the concept of reductionism and antireductionism in Biology, Computer Science and Theoretical Psychology. This work resulted in a collection of four papers which was jointly published as a symposium section in Philosophical Psychology (vol. 14, no. 4, December 2002). Thereafter, our department set out to focus more specifically on the idea of enriching Systems Biology and Philosophy of Biology by the mutual application of insights of both disciplines. To be able to accomplish this ambitious task, we thought it worthwhile to seek support from philosophers to elaborate on a variety of philosophical issues that naturally surfaced when thinking about the foundations of systems biology and what exactly made it so different from molecular biology. We are very grateful to Robert Richardson (Cincinnati, USA) and Achim Stephan (Osnabr{\"{u}}ck, Germany) whom we met in 2002, and with whom we started thinking about central philosophical notions in systems biology. We have had many inspiring and fruitful discussions and their contributions and support were essential to arrive at our current ideas on the foundations of systems biology. In June 2005, our department organized a symposium: Towards a Philosophy of Systems Biology together with Jan-Hendrik Hofmeyr (Department of Biochemistry, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa). It was attended by some 120 persons with various scientific backgrounds. Thirteen Systems Biologists and Philosophers (William Bechtel, David Fell, Jan-Hendrik Hofmeyr, Douglas Kell, Evelyn Fox Keller, Alvaro Moreno, Robert Richardson, Kenneth Schaffner, Robert Shulman, Achim Stephan, Hans Westerhoff, William Wimsatt, and Olaf Wolkenhauer) shed light on themes related to the subject of the symposium. All of them contributed to this book as an author. Werner Callebaut, Ulrich Krohs, and Mukhtar Ullah, who were not present at the symposium, also contributed as authors. We thank the editors at Elsevier, Joke Zwetsloot and Anne Russum, for their help and support. “Systems Biology: Philosophical Foundations” is the first book to be published on philosophical foundations of Systems Biology and we are grateful to have had the opportunity to edit and publish this work.},

abstract = {Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) was developed in the late 1960s to explicate the integrated behavior of intact biochemical systems-specific dynamic behavior as well as general principles of design-in relation to the properties of their underlying molecular elements. This approach was used successfully in a number of biochemical and other biological applications throughout the 1970s and 1980s. A related approach, Metabolic Control Theory (MCT), was proposed in the mid 1970s. Its developments generally have followed without reference the analogous developments in BST, and its proponents have treated the two approaches as if they were unrelated. Detailed comparison of the fundamental structures of BST and MCT shows that, although there are some superficial differences, both in fact are based upon the same underlying formalism. Molecular descriptions in MCT comprise a special case of those in BST. Systemic descriptions differ with respect to the level of aggregation assumed. The aggregation at the level of net increase or net decrease of each system constituent found in BST is shown to produce the more revealing and useful theory, and results presented elsewhere [41] suggest that this level of aggregation also provides a more accurate description of the system. At this fundamental level, MCT represents a special case of BST, for the content and range of validity of BST are more inclusive than those of MCT. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of classification in noisy, high-dimensional, and class-imbalanced protein datasets. In order to design a complete classification system, we use a three-stage machine learning framework consisting of a feature selection stage, a method addressing noise and class-imbalance, and a method for combining biologically related tasks through a prior-knowledge based clustering. In the first stage, we employ Fisher's permutation test as a feature selection filter. Comparisons with the alternative criteria show that it may be favorable for typical protein datasets. In the second stage, noise and class imbalance are addressed by using minority class over-sampling, majority class under-sampling, and ensemble learning. The performance of logistic regression models, decision trees, and neural networks is systematically evaluated. The experimental results show that in many cases ensembles of logistic regression classifiers may outperform more expressive models due to their robustness to noise and low sample density in a high-dimensional feature space. However, ensembles of neural networks may be the best solution for large datasets. In the third stage, we use prior knowledge to partition unlabeled data such that the class distributions among non-overlapping clusters significantly differ. In our experiments, training classifiers specialized to the class distributions of each cluster resulted in a further decrease in classification error. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Brownian motion, the motion of a small particle (pollen) driven by random impulses from the surrounding molecules, may be the first example of a stochastic process in which such forces are expected to emerge. In this note it is shown that at least two types of entropic motion can be identified in the case of 3D Brownian motion (or random walk). This yields simple derivations of known results of Brownian motion, Hook s law and, applying an external (nonradial) force, Curie s law and the Langevin-Debye equation.},

Enzymes therefore need to be studied with natural substrates in the presence of all of the other small molecules likely to affect the activity in vivo, including the reaction products, so that the reverse reac- tion is not artificially prohibited. As complete reversible rate equations are often unmanageably complicated, especially for cooperative kinetics, care needs to be taken in choosing simpler equations that preserve the properties that are relevant in physiological conditions.},

abstract = {Proper functioning of biological cells requires that the process of protein expression be carried out with high efficiency and fidelity. Given an amino-acid sequence of a protein, multiple degrees of freedom still remain that may allow evolution to tune efficiency and fidelity for each gene under various conditions and cell types. Particularly, the redundancy of the genetic code allows the choice between alternative codons for the same amino acid, which, although 'synonymous,' may exert dramatic effects on the process of translation. Here we review modern developments in genomics and systems biology that have revolutionized our understanding of the multiple means by which translation is regulated. We suggest new means to model the process of translation in a richer framework that will incorporate information about gene sequences, the tRNA pool of the organism and the thermodynamic stability of the mRNA transcripts. A practical demonstration of a better understanding of the process would be a more accurate prediction of the proteome, given the transcriptome at a diversity of biological conditions.

abstract = {A four-stage approach to the analysis of control mechanisms has been suggested: (1) the enzymes involved in metabolic regulation are identified; (2) their kinetic properties are investigated in detail; (3) the kinetic properties are used to postulate a hypothesis of metabolic control; and (4) the hypothesis is tested and is modified as necessary. This chapter focuses on the first stage, that is, the identification of those enzymes at which metabolic regulation is exerted. Three general methods of approaching this question have been suggested. The teleological approach depends on the belief that control should occur early in the pathway and shortly after branch points to avoid long stretches of uncontrolled metabolism. A second approach is based on the analysis of the properties of enzymes, on the premise that enzymes possessing such phenomena as changing maximal activities on dietary or hormonal manipulation, low maximal activities in comparison with other enzymes of the pathway, or activation or inhibition by other intermediates are likely control sites. In the third method, intact tissue preparations are subjected to various treatments to give different rates of flow through the metabolic pathway and the steady-state concentrations of intermediates measured and used to deduce sites of metabolic control. This approach permits analysis of intact tissue preparations, and is potentially able to provide unequivocal identification of control sites.},

abstract = {Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature and involve the appearance of long-range correlations. These correlations are not due to thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to {\$}L{\$} spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with {\$}L{\$}, with a coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition. Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science, obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a critical point.},

abstract = {Panspermia, an ancient idea, posits that microbial life is ubiquitous in the Universe. After several decades of almost irrational rejection, panspermia is at last coming to be regarded as a serious contender for the beginnings of life on our planet. Astronomical data is shown to be consistent with the widespread distribution of complex organic molecules and dust particles that may have a biological provenance. A minuscule (10-21) survival rate of freeze-dried bacteria in space is all that is needed to ensure the continual re-cycling of cosmic microbial life in the galaxy. Evidence that terrestrial life may have come from elsewhere in the solar system has accumulated over the past decade. Mars is seen by some as a possible source of terrestrial life, but some hundreds of billions of comets that enveloped the entire solar system, are a far more likely primordial reservoir of life. Comets would then have seeded Earth, Mars, and indeed all other habitable planetary bodies in the inner regions of the solar system. The implications of this point of view, which was developed in conjunction with the late Sir Fred Hoyle since the 1970s, are now becoming amenable to direct empirical test by studies of pristine organic material in the stratosphere. The ancient theory of panspermia may be on the verge of vindication, in which case the entire universe would be a grand crucible of cryomicrobiology. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Diffusive transport of particles or, more generally, small objects is a ubiquitous feature of physical and chemical reaction systems. In configurations containing confining walls or constrictions transport is controlled both by the fluctuation statistics of the jittering objects and the phase space available to their dynamics. Consequently, the study of transport at the macro- and nanoscales must address both Brownian motion and entropic effects. With this survey we report on recent advances in the theoretical and numerical investigation of stochastic transport occurring either in micro-sized geometries of varying cross section or in narrow channels wherein the diffusing particles are hindered from passing each other (single file diffusion). For particles undergoing biased diffusion in static suspension media enclosed by confining geometries, transport exhibits intriguing features such as (i) a decrease of nonlinear mobility with increasing temperature or, also, (ii) a broad excess peak of the effective diffusion above the free diffusion limit. These paradoxical aspects can be understood in terms of entropic contributions resulting from the restricted dynamics in phase space. If, in addition, the suspension medium is subjected to external, time-dependent forcing, rectification or segregation of the diffusing Brownian particles becomes possible. Likewise, the diffusion in very narrow, spatially modulated channels gets modified via contact particle-particle interactions, which induce anomalous sub-diffusion. The effective sub-diffusion constant for a driven single file also develops a resonance-like structure as a function of the confining coupling constant.},

abstract = {Perhaps the major obstacle to recognizing the relatedness of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) and a subsequently developed approach some have called Metabolic Control Theory (MCT) is the summation and connectivity relationships. These are the most visible and central features of the MCT approach to the understanding of intact biochemical systems, whereas in the BST approach they appear to be invisible and peripheral. Generalized versions of these relationships are shown to be inherent to BST, and it is shown how their role differs from that within MCT. The significance of summation and connectivity relationships is shown to be historical and secondary in the sense that one can understand fully the integrated behavior of complex biochemical systems in steady state with BST and never explicitly invoke these relationships. It also is shown that the summation and connectivity relationships in MCT have inherent limitations that make them inadequate as the basis for a general theory of biochemical systems. The results in this paper, together with those in the previous paper, clearly demonstrate that MCT is a special case of BST.},

abstract = {Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) was developed in the late 1960s to explicate the integrated behavior of intact biochemical systems—specific dynamic behavior as well as general principles of design—in relation to the properties of their underlying molecular elements. This approach was used successfully in a number of biochemical and other biological applications throughout the 1970s and 1980s. A related approach, Metabolic Control Theory (MCT), was proposed in the mid 1970s. Its developments generally have followed without reference the analogous developments in BST, and its proponents have treated the two approaches as if they were unrelated. Detailed comparison of the fundamental structures of BST and MCT shows that, although there are some superficial differences, both in fact are based upon the same underlying formalism. Molecular descriptions in MCT comprise a special case of those in BST. Systemic descriptions differ with respect to the level of aggregation assumed. The aggregation at the level of net increase or net decrease of each system constituent found in BST is shown to produce the more revealing and useful theory, and results presented elsewhere [41] suggest that this level of aggregation also provides a more accurate description of the system. At this fundamental level, MCT represents a special case of BST, for the content and range of validity of BST are more inclusive than those of MCT.},

@article{Liebermeister2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Translating a known metabolic network into a dynamic model requires rate laws for all chemical reactions. The mathematical expressions depend on the underlying enzymatic mechanism; they can become quite involved and may contain a large number of parameters. Rate laws and enzyme parameters are still unknown for most enzymes. RESULTS: We introduce a simple and general rate law called "convenience kinetics". It can be derived from a simple random-order enzyme mechanism. Thermodynamic laws can impose dependencies on the kinetic parameters. Hence, to facilitate model fitting and parameter optimisation for large networks, we introduce thermodynamically independent system parameters: their values can be varied independently, without violating thermodynamical constraints. We achieve this by expressing the equilibrium constants either by Gibbs free energies of formation or by a set of independent equilibrium constants. The remaining system parameters are mean turnover rates, generalised Michaelis-Menten constants, and constants for inhibition and activation. All parameters correspond to molecular energies, for instance, binding energies between reactants and enzyme. CONCLUSION: Convenience kinetics can be used to translate a biochemical network--manually or automatically--into a dynamical model with plausible biological properties. It implements enzyme saturation and regulation by activators and inhibitors, covers all possible reaction stoichiometries, and can be specified by a small number of parameters. Its mathematical form makes it especially suitable for parameter estimation and optimisation. Parameter estimates can be easily computed from a least-squares fit to Michaelis-Menten values, turnover rates, equilibrium constants, and other quantities that are routinely measured in enzyme assays and stored in kinetic databases.},

SMI is defined and its properties and time evolution are illustrated, and it is shown that the entropy is a particular type of SMI, i.e. the SMI related to the phase-space distribution for a macroscopic system at equilibrium. The connection to SMI allows the reader to understand what entropy is and why isolated systems follow the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Llaw is also formulated for other systems, not thermally isolated and even open with respect to the transfer of particles. All the fundamental aspects of thermodynamics are derived and illustrated with several examples in the first part of the book.

abstract = {MOTIVATION This article presents libRoadRunner, an extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of models expressed using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). SBML is the most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially biochemical networks. libRoadRunner is fast enough to support large-scale problems such as tissue models, studies that require large numbers of repeated runs and interactive simulations. RESULTS libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings, and interactively through its Python interface. Its Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar to the APIs of MATLAB ( WWWMATHWORKSCOM: ) and SciPy ( HTTP//WWWSCIPYORG/: ), making it fast and easy to learn. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a variety of processors, making it appropriate for solving extremely large models or repeated runs. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) including several SBML extensions (composition and distributions). It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as well as tools for steady-state analysis, stability analysis and structural analysis of the stoichiometric matrix. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION libRoadRunner binary distributions are available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The library is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. libRoadRunner is also available for ARM-based computers such as the Raspberry Pi. http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build instructions, binaries and a git source repository.

abstract = {Background: Computational models in biology encode molecular and cell biological processes. These models often can be represented as biochemical reaction networks. Studying such networks, one is mostly interested in systems that share similar reactions and mechanisms. Typical goals of an investigation include understanding of the parts of a model, identification of reoccurring patterns, and recognition of biologically relevant motifs. The large number and size of available models, however, require automated methods to support researchers in achieving their goals. Specifically for the problem of finding patterns in large networks only partial solutions exist. Results: We propose a workflow that identifies frequent structural patterns in biochemical reaction networks encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language. The workflow utilises a subgraph mining algorithm to detect frequent network patterns. Once patterns are identified, the textual pattern description can automatically be converted into a graphical representation. Furthermore, information about the distribution of patterns among the selected set of models can be retrieved. The workflow was validated with 575 models from the curated branch of BioModels. In this paper, we highlight interesting and frequent structural patterns. Further, we provide exemplary patterns that incorporate terms from the Systems Biology Ontology. Our workflow can be applied to a custom set of models or to models already existing in our graph database MaSyMoS. Conclusions: The occurrences of frequent patterns may give insight into the encoding of central biological processes, evaluate postulated biological motifs, or serve as a similarity measure for models that share common structures.},

abstract = {We have traced the historical link between the Law of Mass Action and clinical pharmacology. The Law evolved from the work of the French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet, was first formulated by Cato Guldberg and Peter Waage in 1864 and later clarified by the Dutch chemist Jacobus van 't Hoff in 1877. It has profoundly influenced our qualitative and quantitative understanding of a number of physiological and pharmacological phenomena. According to the Law of Mass Action, the velocity of a chemical reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants. At equilibrium the concentrations of the chemicals involved bear a constant relation to each other, described by the equilibrium constant, K. The Law of Mass Action is relevant to various physiological and pharmacological concepts, including concentration-effect curves, dose-response curves, and ligand-receptor binding curves, all of which are important in describing the pharmacological actions of medications, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which describes the binding of medications to proteins, activation curves for transmembrane ion transport, enzyme inhibition and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which describes the relation between pH, as a measure of acidity and the concentrations of the contributory acids and bases. Guldberg and Waage recognized the importance of dynamic equilibrium, while others failed to do so. Their ideas, over 150 years old, are embedded in and still relevant to clinical pharmacology. Here we explain the ideas and in a subsequent paper show how they are relevant to understanding adverse drug reactions.Copyright {\&}{\#}xa9; 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.},

abstract = {This year we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the law of mass action. This law is often assumed to have been "there" forever, but it has its own history, background, and a definite starting point. The law has had an impact on chemistry, biochemistry, biomathematics, and systems biology that is difficult to overestimate. It is easily recognized that it is the direct basis for computational enzyme kinetics, ecological systems models, and models for the spread of diseases. The article reviews the explicit and implicit role of the law of mass action in systems biology and reveals how the original, more general formulation of the law emerged one hundred years later ab initio as a very general, canonical representation of biological processes.},

The theory has three main aspects. The first is called "systems science," or the scientific exploration and theory of systems in various sciences. The second is called "systems technology," or the problems arising in modern technology and society. The third aspect is called "systems philosophy" and refers to the reorientation of thought and world view.},

abstract = {Maximization of growth rate is an important fitness strategy for bacteria. Bacteria can achieve this by expressing proteins at optimal concentrations, such that resources are not wasted. This is exemplified for Escherichia coli by the increase of its ribosomal protein-fraction with growth rate, which precisely matches the increased protein synthesis demand. These findings and others have led to the hypothesis that E. coli aims to maximize its growth rate in environments that support growth. However, what kind of regulatory strategy is required for a robust, optimal adjustment of the ribosome concentration to the prevailing condition is still an open question. In the present study, we analyze the ppGpp-controlled mechanism of ribosome expression used by E. coli and show that this mechanism maintains the ribosomes saturated with its substrates. In this manner, overexpression of the highly abundant ribosomal proteins is prevented, and limited resources can be redirected to the synthesis of other growth-promoting enzymes. It turns out that the kinetic conditions for robust, optimal protein-partitioning, which are required for growth rate maximization across conditions, can be achieved with basic biochemical interactions. We show that inactive ribosomes are the most suitable 'signal' for tracking the intracellular nutritional state and for adjusting gene expression accordingly, as small deviations from optimal ribosome concentration cause a huge fractional change in ribosome inactivity. We expect to find this control logic implemented across fast-growing microbial species because growth rate maximization is a common selective pressure, ribosomes are typically highly abundant and thus costly, and the required control can be implemented by a small, simple network.},

abstract = {Previous models of glycolysis in the sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei assumed that the core part of glycolysis in this unicellular parasite is tightly compartimentalized within an organelle, the glycosome, which had previously been shown to contain most of the glycolytic enzymes. The glycosomes were assumed to be largely impermeable, and exchange of metabolites between the cytosol and the glycosome was assumed to be regulated by specific transporters in the glycosomal membrane. This tight compartmentalization was considered to be essential for parasite viability. Recently, size-specific metabolite pores were discovered in the membrane of glycosomes. These channels are proposed to allow smaller metabolites to diffuse across the membrane but not larger ones. In light of this new finding, we re-analyzed the model taking into account uncertainty about the topology of the metabolic system in T. brucei, as well as uncertainty about the values of all parameters of individual enzymatic reactions. Our analysis shows that these newly-discovered nonspecific pores are not necessarily incompatible with our current knowledge of the glycosomal metabolic system, provided that the known cytosolic activities of the glycosomal enzymes play an important role in the regulation of glycolytic fluxes and the concentration of metabolic intermediates of the pathway.},

Ligand engagement with the T-cell receptor (TCR) results in the activation of a complex sequence of signalling events, both on the cell membrane and intracellularly. Feedback is an integral part of these signalling pathways, yet is often ignored in standard accounts of T-cell signalling. Here we show, using a mathematical model, that these feedback loops can explain the ability of the TCR to discriminate between ligands with high specificity and sensitivity, as well as provide a mechanism for sustained signalling. The model also explains the recent counter-intuitive observation that endogenous 'null' ligands can significantly enhance T-cell signalling. Finally, the model may provide an archetype for receptor switching based on kinase-phosphatase switches, and thus be of interest to the wider signalling community.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the recruitment effects of susceptible and infected individuals in order to assess the productivity of an organizational labor force in the presence of HIV/AIDS with preventive and HAART treatment measures in enhancing the workforce output. We consider constant controls as well as time-dependent controls. In the constant control case, we calculate the basic reproduction number and investigate the existence and stability of equilibria. The model is found to exhibit backward and Hopf bifurcations, implying that for the disease to be eradicated, the basic reproductive number must be below a critical value of less than one. We also investigate, by calculating sensitivity indices, the sensitivity of the basic reproductive number to the model's parameters. In the time-dependent control case, we use Pontryagin's maximum principle to derive necessary conditions for the optimal control of the disease. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the analytical results. The cost-effectiveness analysis results show that optimal efforts on recruitment (HIV screening of applicants, etc.) is not the most cost-effective strategy to enhance productivity in the organizational labor force. Hence, to enhance employees' productivity, effective education programs and strict adherence to preventive measures should be promoted.},

However, only with tyrosine were maximal rates achieved (0.2 µg/g/hr) at concentrations below 5 x 10 -4 M. The apparent Km for the overall reaction (tyrosine → norepinephrine) was found to be comparable to that observed for conversion of tyrosine to dopa by purified tyrosine hydroxylase ( 2 x 10 -5 M). These and other factors indicate that conversion of tyrosine to dopa is the rate-limiting step in the formation of norepinephrine in the sympathetic nervous system.

abstract = {The matrix formulation of metabolic control analysis, which states that multiplying the elasticity matrix for any system by the corresponding control matrix yields an identity matrix, can be trans-formed into a statement that multiplying a matrix expressing internal regulatory properties by a matrix expressing external regulatory properties also yields an identity matrix. This transformation supplies the formal basis for metabolic regulation analysis, and provides the key to determining the control structure of a system without the need to know the exact changes in enzyme activities that are made to measure control coefficients. Since the appearance of the original papers on metabolic control analysis [l, 21, two points have been clear: first, the control structure of a metabolic system is conceptually dis-tinct from the study of the mechanisms and kinetics of its constituent enzymes, and ought to be experimentally separ-able from it as well; second, a full understanding of meta-bolic control should lead to an understanding of metabolic regulation. However, although metabolic control analysis can now deal with systems of any complexity [3-61, and is be-coming widely applied [7, 81, these specific goals have not been achieved. Determination of the control structure of a system has continued to require detailed knowledge of the kinetic properties of the constituent enzymes, and the re-lationship of control analysis to the classical study of meta-bolic regulation has remained more obscure than one would wish. In a previous paper [9] we discussed the differences between regulation and control, setting out some of the regu-latory principles that would need to be integrated into a com-plete theory, but we did not arrive at a full mathematical expression of how these principles were related to control analysis. We now show how an apparently trivial point of matrix algebra allows both goals to be reached. Interposing a matrix product equal to an identity matrix between the two terms in the standard matrix representation of control analy-sis transforms it into the basis for regulation analysis and obviates the need for measuring the changes in enzyme ac-tivities that are made to determine control coefficients exper-imentally. THEORY The relationships between control and elasticity coef-ficients have been expressed in a number of matrix-equation formats ' [3 -6, 10 -151.

abstract = {The best known genes of microbes, mice and men are those that specify enzymes. Wild type, mutant and heterozygote for variants of such genes differ in the catalytic activity at the step in the enzyme network specified by the gene in question. The effect on the respective phenotypes of such changes in catalytic activity, however, is not defined by the enzymes change as estimated by in vitro determination of the activities obtained from the extracts of the three groups. In vivo enzymes do not act in isolation, but are kinetically linked to other enzymes via their substrates and products. These interactions modify the effect of enzyme variation on the phenotype, depending on the nature and quantity of the other enzymes present. An output of such a system, say a flux, is therefore a systemic property, and its response to variation at one locus must be measured in the whole system. This response is best described by the sensitivity coefficient, Z, while is defined by the fractional change in flux over the fractional change in enzyme activity. (formula: see text). Its magnitude determines the extent to which a particular enzyme "controls" a particular flux or phenotype and, implicitly, determines the values that the three phenotypes will have. There are as many sensitivity coefficients for a given flux as there are enzymes in the system. It can be shown that the sum of all such coefficients equals unity. (formula: see text). Since n, the number of enzymes, is large, this summation property results in the individual coefficients being small. The effect of making a large change in enzyme activity therefore usually results in only a negligible change in flux. A reduction to 50{\%} activity in the heterozygote, a common feature for many mutants, is therefore not expected to be detectable in the phenotype. The mutant would therefore be described as "recessive". The widespread occurrence of recessive mutants is thus seen to be the inevitable consequence of the kinetic structure of enzyme networks. The ad hoc hypothesis of "modifiers" selected to maximize the fitness of the heterozygote, as proposed by Fisher, is therefore unnecessary. It is based on the false general expectation of an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygote. Wright's analysis, substantially sound in its approach, proposed selection of a "safety factor" in enzyme activity. The derivation of the summation property explains why such safety factors are automatically present in almost all enzymes without selection.},

The framework employs a Monte Carlo sampling procedure to simulate the uncertainty in the kinetic data and applies statistical tools for the identification of the rate-limiting steps in metabolic networks. We applied the proposed framework to a branched biosynthetic pathway and the yeast glycolysis pathway. Anal. of the results allowed us to interpret and predict the responses of metabolic networks to genetic and environmental changes, and to gain insights on how uncertainty in the kinetic mechanisms and kinetic parameters propagate into the uncertainty in predicting network responses. Some of the practical applications of the proposed approach include the identification of drug targets for metabolic diseases and the guidance for design strategies in metabolic engineering for the purposeful manipulation of the metab. of industrial organisms.},

Previous studies on lipid accumulation in oilseed rape have suggested that diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), which catalyses the final step in seed oil biosynthesis, might be an effective target for enhancing seed oil content. Here, increased seed oil content, increased DGAT activity, and reduced substrate:product ratio are demonstrated, as well as reduced flux control by complex lipid assembly, as determined by TDCA in Brassica napus (canola) lines which overexpress the gene encoding type-1 DGAT. Lines overexpressing DGAT1 also exhibited considerably enhanced seed oil content under drought conditions. These results support the use of TDCA in guiding the rational selection of molecular targets for oilseed modification. The most effective lines had a seed oil increase of 14{\%}. Moreover, overexpression of DGAT1 under drought conditions reduced this environmental penalty on seed oil content.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Hyperglycemia in children after cardiac surgery can be treated with intensive insulin therapy, but hypoglycemia is a potential serious side effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of reducing glucose intake below standard intakes to prevent hyperglycemia, on blood glucose concentrations, glucose kinetics and protein catabolism in children after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: Subjects received 4h low glucose (LG; 2.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) and 4h standard glucose (SG; 5.0 mg.kg-1.min-1) infusion in a randomized blinded crossover setting. Simultaneously, an 8h stable isotope tracer protocol was conducted to determine glucose and leucine kinetics. Data as mean +/- SD or median (IQR); comparison by paired samples T-test. RESULTS: Eleven subjects (age 5.1 (20.2) months) were studied 9.5 +/- 1.9 hours post-cardiac surgery. Blood glucose concentrations were lower during LG than SG (LG 7.3 +/- 0.7 vs. SG 9.3 +/- 1.8 mmol.L-1; P{\textless}0.01), although the glycemic target (4.0-6.0 mmol.L-1) was not achieved. No hypoglycemic events occurred. Endogenous glucose production was higher during LG than SG (LG 2.9 +/- 0.8 vs. SG 1.5 +/- 1.1 mg.kg-1.min-1; P=0.02), due to increased glycogenolysis (LG 1.0 +/- 0.6 vs. SG 0.0 +/- 1.0 mg.kg-1.min-1; P{\textless}0.05). Leucine balance, indicating protein balance, was negative but not affected by glucose intake (LG -54.8 +/- 14.6 vs. SG -58.8 +/- 16.7 umol.kg-1.h-1; P=0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Currently recommended glucose intakes aggravated hyperglycemia in children early after cardiac surgery with CPB. Reduced glucose intake decreased blood glucose concentrations without causing hypoglycemia or affecting protein catabolism, but increased glycogenolysis.

abstract = {In the first two papers of this series (immediately preceding, this issue), we characterized the steady-state properties of a model of a fermentation pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in four experimental conditions. In each of these conditions, the pictures obtained by metabolic control analysis and biochemical systems theory were coincident, which illustrates the relatedness of the two approaches. In this paper we analyze the quality of this description by means of the tools available within biochemical systems theory, and we show that in some of the experimental conditions studied the system is poorly characterized. The most critical condition corresponds to the immobilization of the cells at pH 5.5, in which the kinetic characterization appears to be inaccurate. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and the study of the local steady-state stability identify the most critical parameters. The results of these analyses are confirmed by the predictions of the dynamic response of the model using its S-system representation. This illustrates the utility of these tools and warns against using the steady-state characterization without testing its validity. ?? 1995.},

Current metabolic flux analysis approaches are fully based on stoichiometric constraints and carbon atom balances, where the over-determined system is iteratively solved by a parameter estimation approach. However, the unavoidable measurement noises involved in the fractional enrichment data obtained by 13 C-enrichment experiment and the possible existence of unknown pathways prevent a simple parameter estimation method for intracellular flux quantification. The MCMC (Markov chain–Monte Carlo) method, which obtains intracellular flux distributions through delicately constructed Markov chains, is shown to be an effective approach for deep understanding of the intracellular metabolic network. Its application is illustrated through the simulation of an example metabolic network.},

abstract = {The interdependence of the activities of branch point enzymes which compete for a common substrate can yield ultrasensitivity or subsensitivity to control, even if the competing enzymes follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The nature of this "branch point effect" for a particular system depends on the kinetic parameters of the competing enzymes, the rate of substrate production leading into the branch point and the type of regulatory mechanism involved. With physiologically reasonable parameter values, the branch point effect can give ultrasensitivity equivalent to an allosteric enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 8 or higher. An experimental example of this ultrasensitivity was provided by the branch point between isocitrate lyase (of the glyoxylate bypass) and isocitrate dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli. The glyoxylate bypass is very active during growth on acetate but its flux decreases by a factor of approximately 150 upon addition of glucose. This inhibition is brought about by two relatively modest events: a 4-fold increase in the maximum velocity of isocitrate dehydrogenase and a factor of 5.5 decrease in the rate of isocitrate production. The mechanism which underlies this sensitivity amplification is discussed.},

abstract = {We examine the thermodynamic evolution of various evolving systems, from primitive physical systems to complex living systems, and conclude that they involve similar processes which are phenomenological manifestations of the second law of thermodynamics. We take the reformulated second law of thermodynamics of Hatsopoulos and Keenan and Kestin and extend it to nonequilibrium regions, where nonequilibrium is described in terms of gradients maintaining systems at some distance away from equilibrium. The reformulated second law suggests that as systems are moved away from equilibrium they will take advantage of all available means to resist externally applied gradients. When highly ordered complex systems emerge, they develop and grow at the expense of increasing the disorder at higher levels in the system's hierarchy. We note that this behaviour appears universally in physical and chemical systems. We present a paradigm which provides for a thermodynamically consistent explanation of why there is life, including the origin of life, biological growth, the development of ecosystems, and patterns of biological evolution observed in the fossil record. We illustrate the use of this paradigm through a discussion of ecosystem development. We argue that as ecosystems grow and develop, they should increase their total dissipation, develop more complex structures with more energy flow, increase their cycling activity, develop greater diversity and generate more hierarchical levels, all to abet energy degradation. Species which survive in ecosystems are those that funnel energy into their own production and reproduction and contribute to autocatalytic processes which increase the total dissipation of the ecosystem. In short, ecosystems develop in ways which systematically increase their ability to degrade the incoming solar energy. We believe that our thermodynamic paradigm makes it possible for the study of ecosystems to be developed from a descriptive science to predictive science founded on the most basic principle of physics. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: There is an increasing interest to model biochemical and cell biological networks, as well as to the computational analysis of these models. The development of analysis methodologies and related software is rapid in the field. However, the number of available models is still relatively small and the model sizes remain limited. The lack of kinetic information is usually the limiting factor for the construction of detailed simulation models. RESULTS: We present a computational toolbox for generating random biochemical network models which mimic real biochemical networks. The toolbox is called Random Models for Biochemical Networks. The toolbox works in the Matlab environment, and it makes it possible to generate various network structures, stoichiometries, kinetic laws for reactions, and parameters therein. The generation can be based on statistical rules and distributions, and more detailed information of real biochemical networks can be used in situations where it is known. The toolbox can be easily extended. The resulting network models can be exported in the format of Systems Biology Markup Language. CONCLUSION: While more information is accumulating on biochemical networks, random networks can be used as an intermediate step towards their better understanding. Random networks make it possible to study the effects of various network characteristics to the overall behavior of the network. Moreover, the construction of artificial network models provides the ground truth data needed in the validation of various computational methods in the fields of parameter estimation and data analysis.},

Though of similar importance, the reversible Michaelis-Menten scheme is not as well characterized. This is a serious limitation since even enzymatic reactions that go to completion may be reversible. The current work derives a total quasi-steady-state approximation (tQSSA) for the reversible Michaelis-Menten and delineates its validity domain. The tQSSA allows the derivation of uniformly valid approximations for the limit of low enzyme concentrations, ET???ST+KM, and under certain more restrictive conditions also for high enzyme concentrations such that S T???ET+KM. Using these simple analytical approximations, a sequential experimental-theoretical method is suggested for unambiguously estimating all the kinetic parameters of the reversible Michaelis-Menten scheme. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a methodology that enables the determination of the Flux Control Coefficients from transient metabolite concentrations without knowing kinetic parameters. The transient states can be generated by changing the incubation conditions or adding the initial substrate. This approach is suitable for investigating metabolic regulation in vivo or multiple enzyme systems in vitro. It is particularly helpful if used in conjunction with n.m.r. measurements. The approach is based on a relationship between transient metabolite concentrations and the Flux Control Coefficients.

We show how generic reversible rate equations can be recast in two ways, one making the distance from equilibrium explicit, thereby allowing the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control of reaction rate, as well as near-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium reactions. Recasting in the second form separates mass action from rate capacity and quantifies the degree to which intrinsic mass action contributes to reaction rate and how regulation of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction either enhances or counteracts this mass-action behavior.

abstract = {Thermodynamically constrained stoichiometric-based models have been widely used for the estimation of feasible flux distributions of a metabolic network. The prediction of a zero net flux through a reaction indicates that this reaction is either blocked (the enzyme is absent) or at equilibrium (the enzyme is present but the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction is zero). The estimation of the thermodynamic equilibrium of a reaction requires the exact knowledge of environmental conditions and metabolites' concentrations. This information, however, is not always available. Here, the effect of considering that a reaction is at equilibrium instead of being blocked on the metabolic flux distribution is analysed. The central carbon metabolism of Actinobacillus succinogenes for the production of succinic acid from glycerol has been used as case study, based on results from experiments in 1.8L batch bioreactors. The impact of changes in ionic strength (I), temperature (T), intracellular pHc and medium pHe was also investigated, revealing that only I and T affect the prediction of flux distributions compared with those obtained at standard biological conditions when zero flux reactions are considered either as blocked or at equilibrium. In general, the range of fluxes estimated for the equilibrium case is narrower than that for the blocked case.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, small changes in cell volume can serve as important signals for cell proliferation, death, and migration. Volume and shape regulation also directly impacts the mechanics of cells and tissues. Here, we develop a mathemat-ical model of cellular volume and pressure regulation, incorporating essential elements such as water permeation, mechanosen-sitive channels, active ion pumps, and active stresses in the cortex. The model can fully explain recent experimental data, and it predicts cellular volume and pressure for several models of cell cortical mechanics. Moreover, we show that when cells are sub-jected to an externally applied load, such as in an atomic force microscopy indentation experiment, active regulation of volume and pressure leads to a complex cellular response. Instead of the passive mechanics of the cortex, the observed cell stiffness depends on several factors working together. This provides a mathematical explanation of rate-dependent response of cells un-der force.},

abstract = {We present a powerful, general method of fitting a model of a biochemical pathway to experimental substrate concentrations and dynamical properties measured at a stationary state, when the mechanism is largely known but kinetic parameters are lacking. Rate constants and maximum velocities are calculated from the experimental data by simple algebra without integration of kinetic equations. Using this direct approach, we fit a comprehensive model of glycolysis and glycolytic oscillations in intact yeast cells to data measured on a suspension of living cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae near a Hopf bifurcation, and to a large set of stationary concentrations and other data estimated from comparable batch experiments. The resulting model agrees with almost all experimentally known stationary concentrations and metabolic fluxes, with the frequency of oscillation and with the majority of other experimentally known kinetic and dynamical variables. The functional forms of the rate equations have not been optimized.},

In nongrowing, anaerobic, compressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae the values of the kinetic parameters of most glycolytic enzymes were determined. For the other enzymes appropriate literature values were collected. By inserting these values into a kinetic model for glycolysis, fluxes and metabolites were calculated. Under the same conditions fluxes and metabolite levels were measured. In our first model, branch reactions were ignored. This model failed to reach the stable steady state that was observed in the experimental flux measurements. Introduction of branches towards trehalose, glycogen, glycerol and succinate did allow such a steady state. The predictions of this branched model were compared with the empirical behavior. Half of the enzymes matched their predicted flux in vivo within a factor of 2. For the other enzymes it was calculated what deviation between in vivo and in vitro kinetic characteristics could explain the discrepancy between in vitro rate and in vivo flux.},

abstract = {Investments in systems biology approaches by the pharmaceutical industry have not yet yielded the payoffs envisaged by many. In most cases, a plethora of novel drug targets arising from genomics led to many more failed projects in the pipeline, suggesting that target-based drug discovery may not be an optimal strategy for the industry. Before high-throughput '-omics' technologies and computer analysis became commonplace, most drug candidates were laboriously screened in animal systems to identify compounds that produced useful responses. Interestingly, the targets of many of the compounds that became drugs are still uncertain to this day. It is likely that drugs act on multiple targets in concert over time, the identification of which will require not only system level cataloguing and measurements, but next generation multiscale systems modelling. The concept of a 'differentiated drug response'- elucidating and integrating responses composed of a range of effects on different tissues and, importantly, different time scales - may eventually prove to be the dominant paradigm of systems biology research. In this article, we explore key relevant concepts and technologies that we believe are critical for the future of systems biology and its place in pharmaceutical research.},

Metabolomics amplifies changes in the proteome, and represents more closely the phenotype of an organism. Recent advances enable the production (and computer-readable encoding as SBML) of metabolic network models reconstructed from genome sequences, as well as experimental measurements of much of the metabolome. There is increasing convergence between the number of human metabolites estimated via genomics (???3000) and the number measured experimentally. It is thus both timely, and now possible, to bring these two approaches together as an integrated (if distributed) whole to help understand the genesis of metabolic biomarkers, the progress of disease, and the modes of action, efficacy, off-target effects and toxicity of pharmaceutical drugs. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Hydrothermal stability is a pertinent issue to address for many industrial applications where percent levels of water can be present at temperatures ranging from subambient to several hundred degrees. Our objective is to understand relative stabilities of MOF materials through experimental testing combined with molecular modeling. This will enable the ultimate design of materials with improved hydrothermal stability, while maintaining the properties of interest. The tools that we have employed for these studies include quantum mechanical calculations based upon cluster models and combinatorial steaming methods whereby a steam stability map was formulated according to the relative stability of different materials. The experimental steaming method allows for high throughput screening of materials stability over a broad range of steam levels as well as in-depth investigation of structural transformations under more highly resolved conditions, while the cluster model presented here yields the correct trends in hydrothermal stability. Good agreement was observed between predicted relative stabilities of materials by molecular modeling and experimental results. Fundamental information from these studies has provided insight into how metal composition and coordination, chemical functionality of organic linker, framework dimensionality, and interpenetration affect the relative stabilities of PCP materials. This work suggests that the strength of the bond between the metal oxide cluster and the bridging linker is important in determining the hydrothermal stability of the PCP. Although the flexibility of the framework plays a role, it is not as important as the metal-linker bond strength. This demonstration of alignment between experimental and calculated observations has proven the validity of the method, and the insight derived herein insight facilitates direction in designing ideal MOF materials with improved hydrothermal stability for desired applications.},

The present analysis allows for the more general case that some reactions can proceed in either direction. Basic ideas on how to compute the complete set of elementary modes in this situation are outlined and verified by way of several examples, with one of them representing glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

@article{Noor2014,
abstract = {In metabolism research, thermodynamics is usually used to determine the directionality of a reaction or the feasibility of a pathway. However, the relationship between thermodynamic potentials and fluxes is not limited to questions of directionality: thermodynamics also affects the kinetics of reactions through the flux-force relationship, which states that the logarithm of the ratio between the forward and reverse fluxes is directly proportional to the change in Gibbs energy due to a reaction ($\Delta$rG'). Accordingly, if an enzyme catalyzes a reaction with a $\Delta$rG' of -5.7 kJ/mol then the forward flux will be roughly ten times the reverse flux. As $\Delta$rG' approaches equilibrium ($\Delta$rG' = 0 kJ/mol), exponentially more enzyme counterproductively catalyzes the reverse reaction, reducing the net rate at which the reaction proceeds. Thus, the enzyme level required to achieve a given flux increases dramatically near equilibrium. Here, we develop a framework for quantifying the degree to which pathways suffer these thermodynamic limitations on flux. For each pathway, we calculate a single thermodynamically-derived metric (the Max-min Driving Force, MDF), which enables objective ranking of pathways by the degree to which their flux is constrained by low thermodynamic driving force. Our framework accounts for the effect of pH, ionic strength and metabolite concentration ranges and allows us to quantify how alterations to the pathway structure affect the pathway's thermodynamics. Applying this methodology to pathways of central metabolism sheds light on some of their features, including metabolic bypasses (e.g., fermentation pathways bypassing substrate-level phosphorylation), substrate channeling (e.g., of oxaloacetate from malate dehydrogenase to citrate synthase), and use of alternative cofactors (e.g., quinone as an electron acceptor instead of NAD). The methods presented here place another arrow in metabolic engineers' quiver, providing a simple means of evaluating the thermodynamic and kinetic quality of different pathway chemistries that produce the same molecules.},

Much progress has been made on the extension of FBA to incorporate a priori biological knowledge, provide more practical descriptions of observed cell behaviours, and predict the outcome of network perturbations. Metabolomics is independently advancing as a set of high-throughput data acquisition tools providing dynamic profiles of metabolites in an unbiased manner. These data sets are neither yet sufficiently comprehensive nor accurate enough for generating large-scale kinetic models. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop quantitative techniques that can make use of the emerging data and embrace the associated uncertainties. This article reviews recent advances in FBA to meet this need and discusses the utility of FBA as a complement to metabolomics and the expected synergy as a result of combining these two techniques.},

abstract = {First, we report the application of stable isotope dilution theory in metabolome characterization of aerobic glucose limited chemostat culture of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-7D using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization MS/MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS). A glucose-limited chemostat culture of S. cerevisiae was grown to steady state at a specific growth rate (mu)=0.05 h(-1) in a medium containing only naturally labeled (99{\%} U-12C, 1{\%} U-13C) carbon source. Upon reaching steady state, defined as 5 volume changes, the culture medium was switched to chemically identical medium except that the carbon source was replaced with 100{\%} uniformly (U) 13C labeled stable carbon isotope, fed for 4 h, with sampling every hour. We observed that within a period of 1 h approximately 80{\%} of the measured glycolytic metabolites were U-13C-labeled. Surprisingly, during the next 3 h no significant increase of the U-13C-labeled metabolites occurred. Second, we demonstrate for the first time the LC-ESI-MS/MS-based quantification of intracellular metabolite concentrations using U-13C-labeled metabolite extracts from chemostat cultivated S. cerevisiae cells, harvested after 4 h of feeding with 100{\%} U-13C-labeled medium, as internal standard. This method is hereby termed "Mass Isotopomer Ratio Analysis of U-13C Labeled Extracts" (MIRACLE). With this method each metabolite concentration is quantified relative to the concentration of its U-13C-labeled equivalent, thereby eliminating drawbacks of LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis such as nonlinear response and matrix effects and thus leads to a significant reduction of experimental error and work load (i.e., no spiking and standard additions). By coextracting a known amount of U-13C labeled cells with the unlabeled samples, metabolite losses occurring during the sample extraction procedure are corrected for.},

abstract = {Metabolic control analysis predicts that effects on tumor growth are likely to be obtained with lower concentrations of drug, if an enzyme with a high control coefficient on tumor growth is being inhibited. Here we measure glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) control coefficient on in vivo tumor growth using mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. We used dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), an uncompetitive inhibitor of this enzyme and the in situ cytochemical method to measure the enzyme activity changes that accompany changes on tumor cell growth. This method ensures that the enzyme activity determined is the one existing in the in situ conditions and enables computing a control coefficient in in situ conditions. From the data obtained on tumor cell number and the in situ enzyme activities in absence and presence of DHEA-S, a control coefficient of 0.41 for G6PDH on tumor cell growth was computed. This value is approximately the half of the transketolase control coefficient value of 0.9 previously reported. Moreover, the use of in situ methods to assess enzyme activities, applied for first time for the calculation of control coefficients in this study, opens new avenues to the use of uncompetitive inhibitors for the measurement of in situ control coefficients.},

abstract = {A new form of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) called thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis (TMFA) is introduced with the capability of generating thermodynamically feasible flux and metabolite activity profiles on a genome scale. TMFA involves the use of a set of linear thermodynamic constraints in addition to the mass balance constraints typically used in MFA. TMFA produces flux distributions that do not contain any thermodynamically infeasible reactions or pathways, and it provides information about the free energy change of reactions and the range of metabolite activities in addition to reaction fluxes. TMFA is applied to study the thermodynamically feasible ranges for the fluxes and the Gibbs free energy change, $\Delta${\^{}}sub r{\^{}}G', of the reactions and the activities of the metabolites in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli developed by Palsson and co-workers. In the TMFA of the genome scale model, the metabolite activities and reaction $\Delta${\^{}}sub r{\^{}}G' are able to achieve a wide range of values at optimal growth. The reaction dihydroorotase is identified as a possible thermodynamic bottleneck in E. coli metabolism with a $\Delta${\^{}}sub r{\^{}}G' constrained close to zero while numerous reactions are identified throughout metabolism for which $\Delta${\^{}}sub r{\^{}}G' is always highly negative regardless of metabolite concentrations. As it has been proposed previously, these reactions with exclusively negative $\Delta${\^{}}sub r{\^{}}G' might be candidates for cell regulation, and we find that a significant number of these reactions appear to be the first steps in the linear portion of numerous biosynthesis pathways. The thermodynamically feasible ranges for the concentration ratios ATP/ADP, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H, and H+{\^{}}sub extracellular{\^{}}/H+{\^{}}sub intracellular{\^{}} are also determined and found to encompass the values observed experimentally in every case. Further, we find that the NAD/NADH and NADP/NADPH ratios maintained in the cell are close to the minimum feasible ratio and maximum feasible ratio, respectively.},

abstract = {In this minireview, several different approaches to derivation of the theorems and relationships of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) are discussed and an alternative approach is presented. This new approach consists of solving the steady-state mass balances for the intracellular metabolites using linearized kinetics. The application of linearized kinetics reflects the fact that MCA is based on linearization of the system equations in a reference steady state. Our derivation is valid for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity, including those contain-ing conserved moieties and branches. The value of our approach is its simplicity: the derivation is straightforward and therefore easy to follow. It can serve as a compact introduction to the mathematical basis of MCA.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new mathematical framework for modeling of in vivo dynamics and for metabolic re-design: the linlog approach. This approach is an extension of metabolic control analysis (MCA), valid for large changes of enzyme and metabolite levels. Furthermore, the presented framework combines MCA with kinetic modeling, thereby also combining the merits of both approaches. The linlog framework includes general expressions giving the steady-state fluxes and metabolite concentrations as a function of enzyme levels and extracellular concentrations, and a metabolic design equation that allows direct calculation of required enzyme levels for a desired steady state when control and response coefficients are available. Expressions giving control coefficients as a function of the enzyme levels are also derived. The validity of the linlog approximation in metabolic modeling is demonstrated by application of linlog kinetics to a branched pathway with moiety conservation, reversible reactions and allosteric interactions. Results show that the linlog approximation is able to describe the non-linear dynamics of this pathway very well for concentration changes up to a factor 20. Also the metabolic design equation was tested successfully. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
